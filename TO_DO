*Grammar classes should support different moves (proposals).
*MCMC sampler should be able to use these different moves with different strategies
	*Possible moves can be given as a list to MCMCSampler at init or better: Grammar classes
		can have a moves attribute which is a list of proposal functions
	*We can also specify how to use these rules; such as use one rule randomly in each iteration, 
		or use all of them consecutively on the current state in each iteration
*Acceptance probabilities should depend on proposal, now there's a single acceptance prob. method,
	but depending on the move used acceptance probabilities may be different.
